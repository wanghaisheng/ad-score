# Creative patterns

Creative Patterns are repeated and proven effective components of successful TikTok ads. They help you understand which elements or attributes in a creative are driving performance. Here are some key creative patterns based on successful ad performances:

1. Product Demonstration: This pattern involves showing the product in use, which can help to make potential customers understand how the product works and how it can solve their problems. For instance, the skincare ad and the medicine ad both utilized this pattern to demonstrate the effectiveness of their products.

2. Problem and Solution: This pattern addresses a problem that the target audience may have, and then shows how the product or service can solve that problem. The real estate information ad used this pattern effectively by addressing the problem of homeowners selling their houses and offering a solution through their service.

3. Relatable Problems: This pattern involves presenting a common problem that the target audience can relate to. This can help to grab attention and make the audience feel that the ad is speaking directly to them. The skincare ad and the real estate information ad both used this pattern to great effect.

4. Use of Real Person & Scene: This pattern involves using real people and scenes in the ad. This can help to make the ad feel more authentic and relatable, which can increase engagement and trust in the product or service. The real estate information ad used this pattern to effectively showcase their service.

For video creation, you can leverage these creative patterns to enhance the effectiveness of your ads. For instance, if you're promoting the 'Father Archetype' in the education industry, you might consider demonstrating how your product or service works, presenting a relatable problem and showing how it can be solved, or using real people and scenes to make your ad more authentic and engaging. Remember, the suggested video duration range is 9-33 seconds, depending on the industry and message you want to convey.
